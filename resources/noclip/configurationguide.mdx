## Configuration Guide

<Info>
    This resource does not need any type of framework!
</Info>

<Tip>
    If you don’t know how to get your Bot Token or Guild ID, look it up on youtube, there are countless tutorials!
</Tip>

You have to create a new discord bot token, this can be created [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). It needs to have administrator permissions, this is so it can pull players discord roles.

```lua sv-config.lua
SVConfig.Token = ''
```

Discord Guild Id, to get this enable discord developer mode and right click your servers discord icon, and press “Copy ID”. For a more in depth tutorial follow [this](https://poshbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/backends/setup-discord-backend/#:~:text=Find%20your%20Guild%20ID%20(Server%20ID),-You%20will%20need&text=Go%20to%20Appearance%20and%20enable,can%20disable%20Developer%20Mode%20now.).

```lua sv-config.lua
SVConfig.Guild = ''
```

Here's where you configure which roles have access to noclip and any specific permissions they should have.

```lua sv-config.lua
SVConfig.Roles = {
    {
        RoleId = 000000000000, -- The role id from discord
        Zones = false, -- If the player needs to be within zones
    },
    {
        RoleId = 000000000000, -- The role id from discord
        Zones = true, -- If the player needs to be within zones
    },
}
```

Here's where you define your zones. You can create designated areas and set specific permissions for each zone.

```lua config.lua
Conifg.Zones = {
    {
        coords = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
        radius = 0.0
    },
}
```

The command for the noclip to toggle

```lua config.lua
Config.Command = 'noclip' -- this is the command to toggle noclip
```

The keybind for the noclip to toggle

```lua config.lua
Config.Keybind = 'F3' -- set this to false to disable
```
